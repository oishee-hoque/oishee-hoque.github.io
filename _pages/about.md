I am a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science), currently advised by [Dr. Madhav Marathe](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/madhav-marathe) in the [Biocomplexity Institute](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/). My research interests include, but are not limited to, Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Data Analysis. My current research focuses on (i) designing AI and science-guided machine learning frameworks for effective seasonal and long-horizon planning, forecasting, and allocation decisions. (ii) Also, analysis of NPI data to better understand the pandemic.

I have completed my undergrad in Computer Science from [Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology (AUST)](http://aust.edu/). After graduation, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Enosis Solutions](https://www.enosisbd.com/), Bangladesh for a year.
