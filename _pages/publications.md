## Undergraduate Thesis [2018-2019]

- **REAL-TIME BANGLADESHI SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTION USING FASTER R-CNN**:
  <br>
  Accepted as a Full Paper in ICIET 2018.
  This is a real-time system which detects sign from a video and classifies the sign in the video. For the purpose of our work, we developed a robust dataset from scratch - **BdSLImSet** - which is available for further research. Our system is trained on Faster R-CNN and detects the sign with great accuracy. [[**Paper**]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12813) [[**Dataset**]](https://github.com/imruljubair/BdSLImset)

- **BANGLADESHI SIGN WORD RECOGNITION USING LSTM**:
  <br>
  This is a system which detects sign words -sequence of actions- from a video. This works with sequential data and falls under the domain of action recognition. For the purpose of our work, we developed a robust dataset from scratch - **BdSLVidSet** - which is available for further research. This dataset is trained using CNN for feature extraction and LSTM to combine the sequential feature to recognize the words. [**Dataset**](https://github.com/anno23/Dataset2)
